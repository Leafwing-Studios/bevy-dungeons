# Generation Workflow {stub}



### Metadata

## Constraints
- [required] Must fit an ECS architecture
- [required] Must be modularizable on various dungeon hyperparameters (see Global Metadata)
- [required] Must be style-agnostic
- [required] Output must have an underlying data model that computers can work with (graph, tree, etc.)
- [expected] Whole workflow can be swapped out with relative ease

## Tolerances
- sample

## Uncertainties
- What data model is this workflow expecting as input?
- What data model does this workflow create as output?
- What are the breakpoints within this workflow, and what data models do you have at each breakpoint?
